# Getting Start

`'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'ix'`

[issue 39](https://github.com/julioasotodv/spark-df-profiling/issues/39)

```
Another thing you could if you use pip is pull directly from Github, putting in your requirements.txt file: git+https://github.com/julioasotodv/spark-df-profiling instead of spark-df-profiling

+1 for a new release with the more recent Pandas things and deprecation of ix though ðŸ‘€
```

Done
